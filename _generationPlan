  "estimatedChallenges": [
    {
      "component": "Navigation",
      "challenge": "Mega-menu dropdown for practice areas with proper mobile behavior",
      "mitigation": "Use state management for dropdown toggle, responsive hamburger menu for mobile with accordion-style practice areas"
    },
    {
      "component": "ConsultationForm",
      "challenge": "Multi-step form state management and validation across steps",
      "mitigation": "Use React state for form data, validate each step before proceeding, show progress indicator"
    },
    {
      "component": "AttorneyProfile",
      "challenge": "Complex data structure with education, bar admissions, cases arrays",
      "mitigation": "Define clear TypeScript interface, use map() for arrays with proper keys, handle optional fields gracefully"
    },
    {
      "component": "PracticeAreaDetail",
      "challenge": "Dynamic content for 6 different practice areas",
      "mitigation": "Create reusable component with props for area-specific content, use consistent structure across all areas"
    },
    {
      "component": "CaseResults",
      "challenge": "Displaying outcomes while respecting confidentiality",
      "mitigation": "Use client initials, general outcome descriptions, practice area tags without identifying details"
    },
    {
      "component": "ContactForm",
      "challenge": "Complex validation for legal inquiry form with multiple field types",
      "mitigation": "Implement field-by-field validation, clear error messages, use proper HTML5 input types"
    },
    {
      "component": "PricingCards",
      "challenge": "Presenting various pricing structures (hourly, flat fee, retainer) clearly",
      "mitigation": "Use card layout with clear labels, feature lists, and 'Starting at' language for flexibility"
    },

      "component": "BlogList",
      "challenge": "Filtering and search functionality for articles",
      "mitigation": "Implement client-side filtering with state, use search input to filter by title/content, category buttons"
    }
  ],
  "fixerContext": {
    "expectedStructure": "Simple Next.js app. Components in components/ folder at root. app/page.tsx imports from ../components/. Each page (home, reservation, about, services, contact, pricing, blog) imports shared components like Navigation and Footer, plus page-specific sections.",
    "importPaths": "Use '../components/ComponentName' from app/page.tsx and other pages. All shared components (Navigation, Footer, ConsultationCTA) imported consistently across pages.",
    "sharedStyling": "All components use consistent Tailwind classes with navy blue (blue-900), gold accents (yellow-600), and professional spacing. Typography uses serif for headings, sans-serif for body text.",
    "commonIssues": [
      "Missing 'use client' directive on interactive components (forms, dropdowns, carousels)",
      "Import path mismatches between pages - ensure all use '../components/'",
      "Form validation not implemented - add proper error states",
      "Missing responsive classes - ensure mobile-first approach",
      "Inconsistent color schemes across pages - use centralized color variables",
      "Attorney profile arrays not mapped with proper keys",
      "Mega-menu dropdown state not properly managed",
      "Multi-step form losing state between steps",
      "Missing TypeScript types for attorney and case result data",
      "Footer practice area links not matching services page structure"
    ],
    "criticalForMultiPage": {
      "navigation": "Navigation component must have ALL 7 pages linked: Home, Book Consultation, About, Practice Areas, Contact, Pricing, Legal Resources (Blog). Links must work across all pages.",
      "designConsistency": "CRITICAL - All pages share: Navy blue primary color, gold accents, serif headings, sans-serif body, professional photo style, consultation CTA placement, footer structure.",
      "contentCoherence": "Each page references others: Home features attorneys from About, Services practice areas link to relevant attorneys, Consultation booking mentions Pricing, Blog authors are attorneys from About.",
      "brandVoice": "Authoritative yet approachable. Professional without being intimidating. Confident in expertise while emphasizing client care and accessibility."
